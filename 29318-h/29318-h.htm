<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>ILLUSTRATIONS OF CHAUCER, NO. VI.</h3>

  <p>Unless Chaucer had intended to mark with particular exactness the day
  of the journey to Canterbury, he would not have taken such unusual
  precautions to protect his text from ignorant or careless transcribers.
  We find him not only recording the altitudes of the sun, at different
  hours, in words; but also corroborating those words by associating them
  with physical facts incapable of being perverted or misunderstood.</p>

  <p>Had Chaucer done this in one instance only, we might imagine that it
  was but another of those occasions, so frequently seized upon by him, for
  the display of a little scientific knowledge; but when he repeats the
  very same precautionary expedient again, in the afternoon of the same
  day, we begin to perceive that he must have had some fixed purpose;
  because, as I shall presently show, it is the repetition alone that
  renders the record imperishable.</p>

  <p>But whether Chaucer really devised this method for the express purpose
  of preserving his text, or not, it has at least had that
  effect,&mdash;for while there are scarcely two MSS. extant which agree in
  the verbal record of the day and hours, the physical circumstances
  remain, and afford at all times independent data for the recovery or
  correction of the true reading.</p>

  <p>The day of the month may be deduced from the declination of the sun;
  and, to obtain the latter, all the data required are,</p>

  <p>1. The latitude of the place.</p>

  <p>2. Two altitudes of the sun at different sides of noon.</p>

  <p>It is not absolutely necessary to have any previous knowledge of the
  hours at which these altitudes were respectively obtained, because these
  may be discovered by the trial method of seeking two such hours as shall
  most nearly agree in requiring a declination common to both at the known
  altitudes. Of course it will greatly simplify the process if we
  furthermore know that the observations must have been obtained at some
  determinate intervals of time, such, for example, as complete hours.</p>

  <p>Now, in the Prologue to the "Canterbury Tales" we know that the
  observations could not have been recorded except at complete hours,
  because the construction of the metre will not admit the supposition of
  any parts of hours having been expressed.</p>

  <p>We are also satisfied that there can be no mistake in the altitudes,
  because nothing can alter the facts, that an equality between the length
  of the shadow and the height of the substance can only subsist at an
  altitude of 45 degrees; or that an altitude of 29 degrees (more or less)
  is the nearest that will give the ratio of 11 to 6 between the shadow and
  its gnomon.</p>

<p><!-- Page 386 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page386"></a>{386}</span></p>

  <p>With these data we proceed to the following comparison:</p>

  <p>Here we immediately select "X <span class="scac">A.M.</span>" and "IV
  <span class="scac">P.M.</span>" as the only two items at all approaching
  to similarity; while, in these the approach is so near that they differ
  by only a single minute of a degree!</p>

  <p>More conclusive evidence therefore could scarcely exist that these
  were the hours intended to be recorded by Chaucer, and that the sun's
  declination, designed by him, was somewhere about thirteen degrees and a
  half North.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, this declination would more properly apply to the
  17th of April, in Chaucer's time, than to the 18th; but since he does not
  profess to critical exactness, and since it is always better to adhere to
  written authority, when it is not grossly and obviously corrupt, such
  MSS. as name the 18th of April ought to be respected; but Tyrwhitt's
  "28th," which he states not only as the result of his own conjecture but
  as authorised by the "the best MSS.," ought to be scouted at once.</p>

  <p>In the latest edition of the "Canterbury Tales" (a literal reprint
  from one of the Harl. MSS., for the Percy Society, under the supervision
  of Mr. Wright), the opening of the Prologue to "The Man of Lawes Tale"
  does not materially differ from Tyrwhitt's text, excepting in properly
  assigning the day of the journey to "the eightetene day of April;" and
  the confirmation of the forenoon altitude is as follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And sawe wel that the schade of every tree</p>
      <p>Was in the lengthe the same quantite,</p>
      <p>That was the body erecte that caused it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But the afternoon observation is thus related:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"By that the Manciple had his tale endid,</p>
      <p>The sonne fro the southe line is descendid</p>
      <p>So lowe that it nas nought to my sight,</p>
      <p>Degrees nyne and twenty as in hight.</p>
      <p><i>Ten</i> on the clokke it was as I gesse,</p>
      <p>For eleven foote, or litil more or lesse,</p>
      <p>My schadow was at thilk time of the yere,</p>
      <p>Of which feet as my lengthe parted were,</p>
      <p>In sixe feet equal of proporcioun."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In a note to the line "Ten on the clokke" Mr. Wright observes,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Ten</i>. I have not ventured to change the reading of the Harl.
  MS., which is partly supported by that of the lands. MS.,
  <i>than</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If the sole object were to present an exact counterpart of the MS., of
  course even its errors were to be respected: but upon no other grounds
  can I understand why a reading should be preserved by which broad
  sunshine is attributed to ten o'clock at night! Nor can I believe that
  the copyist of the MS. with whom the error must have originated would
  have set down anything so glaringly absurd, unless he had in his own mind
  some means of reconciling it with probability. It may, I believe, be
  explained in the circumstance that "ten" and "four," in horary reckoning,
  were <i>convertible terms</i>. The old Roman method of naming the hours,
  wherein noon was the sixth, was long preserved, especially in conventual
  establishments: and I have no doubt that the English idiomatic phrase
  "o'clock" originated in the necessity for some distinguishing mark
  between hours "of the clock" reckoned from midnight, and hours of the day
  reckoned from sunrise, or more frequently from six <span
  class="scac">A.M.</span> With such an understanding, it is clear that
  <i>ten</i> might be called <i>four</i>, and <i>four ten</i>, and yet the
  same identical hour to be referred to; nor is it in the least difficult
  to imagine that some monkish transcriber, ignorant perhaps of the meaning
  of "o'clock," might fancy he was correcting, rather that corrupting,
  Chaucer's text, by changing "foure" into "ten."</p>

  <p>I have, I trust, now shown that all these circumstances related by
  Chaucer, so far from being hopelessly incongruous, are, on the contrary,
  harmoniously consistent;&mdash;that they all tend to prove that the day
  of the journey to Canterbury could not have been later than the 18th of
  April;&mdash;that the times of observation were certainly 10 <span
  class="scac">A.M.</span> and 4 <span class="scac">P.M.</span>;&mdash;that
  the "arke of his artificial day" is to be understood as the horizontal or
  azimuthal arch;&mdash;and that the "halfe cours in the Ram" alludes to
  the completion of the last twelve degrees of that sign, about the end of
  the second week in April.</p>

  <p>There yet remains to be examined the signification of those three very
  obscure lines which immediately follow the description, already quoted,
  of the afternoon observation:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Therewith the Mones exaltacioun</p>
      <p>In mena Libra, alway gan ascende</p>
      <p>As we were entryng at a townes end."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is the more unfortunate that we should not be certain what it was
  that Chaucer really did write, inasmuch as he probably intended to
  present, in these lines, some means of identifying the year, similar to
  those he had previously given with respect to the day.</p>

  <p>When Tyrwhitt, therefore, remarks, "In what year this happened Chaucer
  does not inform us"&mdash;he was not astronomer enough to know that if
  Chaucer had meant to leave, in these lines, a record of the moon's place
  on the day of the journey, he could not have chosen a more certain method
  of informing us in what year it occurred.</p>

  <p>But as the present illustration has already extended far enough for
  the limits of a single number of "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>," I shall defer the <!-- Page 387 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page387"></a>{387}</span>investigation of this
  last and greatest difficulty to my next communication.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Verses in Pope</i>&mdash;<i>"Bug" or "Bee."</i>&mdash;Pope, in the
  <i>Dunciad</i>, speaking of the purloining propensities of Bays, has the
  lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Next o'er his books his eyes began to roll,</p>
      <p>In pleasing memory of all he stole;</p>
      <p>How here he sipp'd, how there he plunder'd snug,</p>
      <p>And suck'd all o'er, like an industrious bug."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In reading these lines, some time ago, I was forcibly struck with the
  incongruity of the terms "sipp'd" and "industrious" as applied to "bug;"
  and it occurred to me that Pope may have originally written the passage
  with the words "free" and "bee," as the rhymes of the two last lines. My
  reasons for this conjecture are these: 1st. Because Pope is known to have
  been very fastidious on the score of coarse or vulgar expressions; and
  his better judgment would have recoiled from the use of so offensive a
  word as "bug." 2ndly. Because, as already stated, the terms "sipp'd" and
  "industrious" are inapplicable to a bug. Of the bug it may be said, that
  it "sucks" and "plunders;" but it cannot, with any propriety, be
  predicated of it, as of the bee, that it "sips" and is "industrious." My
  impression is, that when Pope found he was doing too much honour to
  Tibbald by comparing him to a bee, he substituted the word "bug" and its
  corresponding rhyme, without reflecting that some of the epithets,
  already applied to the one, are wholly inapplicable to the other.</p>

  <p><i>Rub-a-dub.</i>&mdash;This word is put forward as an instance of how
  new words are still formed with a view to similarity of sound with the
  sound of what they are intended to express, by Dr. Francis Lieber, in a
  "Paper on the Vocal Sounds of Laura Bridgeman compared with the Elements
  of Phonetic Language," and its authorship is assigned <!-- Page 388
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page388"></a>{388}</span>to Daniel
  Webster, who said in a speech of July 17, 1850:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"They have been beaten incessantly every month, and every day, and
  every hour, by the din, and roll, and <i>rub-a-dub</i> of the Abolition
  presses."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dr. L. adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"No dictionary in my possession has <i>rub-a-dub</i>; by and by the
  lexicographer will admit this, as yet, half-wild word."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>My note is, that though this word be not recognised by the
  dictionaries, yet it is by no means so new as Dr. L. supposes; for I
  distinctly remember that, some four-and-twenty years ago, one of those
  gay-coloured books so common on the shelves of nursery libraries had,
  amongst other equally <i>recherché</i> couplets, the following attached
  to a gaudy print of a military drum:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Not a <i>rub-a-dub</i> will come</p>
      <p>To sound the music of a drum:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>&mdash;no great authority certainly, but sufficient to give the word a
  greater antiquity than Dr. L. claims for it; and no doubt some of your
  readers will be able to furnish more dignified instances of its use.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[To this it may be added, that <i>Dub-a-dub</i> is found in
  Halliwell's <i>Arch. Gloss.</i> with the definition, "To beat a drum;
  also, the blow on the drum. 'The dub-a-dub of honour.' Woman is a
  weathercock, p. 21., there used metaphorically." Mr. Halliwell might also
  have cited the nursery rhyme:</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>2. "<i>Nature's mother-wit.</i>" This phrase is found in Dryden's "Ode

  canto x. verse 21. Where does it first occur?</p>

  <p>3. "The divine chit-chat of Cowper." Query, Who first designated the

  <p><i>Minnis.</i>&mdash;There are (or there were) in East Kent seven
  Commons known by the local term "Minnis," viz., 1. Ewell Minnis; 2. River
  do.; 3. Cocclescombe do.; 4. Swingfield do.; 5. Worth do.; 6. Stelling
  do.; 7. Rhode do. Hasted (<i>History of Kent</i>) says he is at a loss
  for the origin of the word, unless it be in the Latin "Mina," a certain
  quantity of land, among different nations of different sizes; and he
  refers to Spelman's <i>Glossary</i>, verbum "Mina."</p>

  <p>Now the only three with which I am acquainted, River, Ewell, and
  Swingfield Minnis, near Dover, are all on high ground; the two former
  considerably elevated above their respective villages.</p>

  <p>One would rather look for a Saxon than a Celtic derivation in East
  Kent; but many localities, &amp;c. there still retain British or Celtic
  names, and eminently so the stream that runs through River and Ewell, the
  Dour or Dwr, <i>unde</i>, no doubt, Dover, where it disembogues into the
  sea. May we not therefore likewise seek in the same language an
  interpretation of this (at least as far as I know) hitherto unexplained
  term?</p>

  <p>In Armorican we find "Menez" and "Mene," a mount. In the kindred
  dialect, Cornish, "Menhars" means a boundary-stone; "Maenan" (Brit.),
  stoney moor; "Mynydh" (Brit.), a mountain, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>As my means of research are very limited, I can only hazard a
  conjecture, which it will give me much pleasure to see either refuted or
  confirmed by those better informed.</p>

  <p><i>Brighton.</i>&mdash;It is stated in Lyell's <i>Principles of
  Geology</i>, that in the reign of Elizabeth the town of Brighton was
  situated on that tract where the Chain Pier now extends into the sea;
  that in 1665 twenty-two tenements still remained under the cliffs; that
  no traces of the town are perceptible; that the sea has resumed its
  ancient position, the site of the old town having been merely a beach
  abandoned by the ocean for ages. On referring to the "Attack of the
  French on Brighton in 1545," as represented in the engraving in the
  <i>Archæologia</i>, April 14, 1831, I find the town standing
  <i>apparently</i> just where it is now, with "a felde in the middle," but
  with some houses on the beach opposite what is not Pool Valley, on the
  east side of which houses the French are landing; the beach end of the
  road from Lewes.</p>

  <p><i>Voltaire's "Henriade."</i>&mdash;I have somewhere seen an admirable

  <i>antè</i>, p. 330.)</p>

  <p>The house in which Voltaire was born, at Chatnaye, about ten miles
  from Paris, is now the property of the Comtesse de Boigne, widow of the
  General de Boigne, and daughter of the Marquis d'Osmond, who was
  ambassador here during the reign of Louis XVIII. The mother of the poet
  being on a visit with <i>the then</i> proprietor (whose name I cannot
  recollect), was unexpectedly confined. There is a street in the village
  called the Rue Voltaire. The Comtesse de Boigne is my <!-- Page 389

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>THE BLAKE FAMILY.</h3>

  <p>The renowned Admiral Blake, a native of Bridgewater, and possessed of
  property in the neighbourhood, left behind him a numerous family of
  brothers, sisters, nephews, and nieces, settled in the county of
  Somerset; to wit, his brothers Humphrey, William, George, Nicholas,
  Benjamin, and Alexander all survived him, as did also his sisters, Mrs.
  Bowdich, of Chard, and Mrs. Smith, of Cheapside, in London. His brother
  Samuel, killed in an early part of the Civil War, left two sons, Robert
  and Samuel, both of them honourably remembered in the will of their great
  uncle. Can any of your readers, acquainted with Somerset genealogies,
  give me any information which may enable me to make out the descent of
  the present families of Blake, in that county, from this stock?</p>

  <p>There are at least two Blake houses now in existence, who are probably
  of the blood of the illustrious admiral; the Blakes of Bishop's Hall,
  near Taunton, of which William Blake, Esq., a magistrate for the county,
  is the head; and the Blakes of Venue House, Upton, near Wiveliscombe, the
  representative of which is Silas Wood Blake, son of Dr. William Blake, a
  bencher of the Inner Temple. These families possess many relics of the
  admiral&mdash;family papers, cabinets, portrait, and even estates; and
  that they are of his blood there are other reasons for believing; but, so
  far as I know, the line is not clearly traced back. In a funeral sermon
  spoken on the death of the grandfather of the present William Blake,
  Esq., of Bishop's Hall, I find it stated that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He was descended from pious and worthy ancestors; a collateral branch
  of the family of that virtuous man, great officer, and true patriot,
  Admiral Blake. His grandfather, the Rev. Malachi Blake, a Nonconformist
  minister, resided at Blogden, four miles from Taunton. This gentleman, by
  his pious labours, laid the foundation of the dissenting congregation at
  Wellington, in the county of Somerset. After the defeat of the Duke of
  Monmouth, to whose cause he had been friendly, he was obliged to flee
  from home, and went to London disguised in a lay-dress, with a tye-wig
  and a sword."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This minister had three sons, John, Malachi, and William; and it is
  from the last named that the Blakes of Bishop's Hall are descended. But
  who was the father of Malachi Blake himself? He was probably a son or
  grandson of one of the admiral's brothers&mdash;but of which?</p>

  <p>Permit me to add to this Query another remark. I am engaged in writing
  a Life of Admiral Blake, and shall be extremely grateful to any of your
  correspondents who can and will direct me, either through the medium of
  your columns or by private communication, to any new sources of
  information respecting his character and career. A meagre pamphlet being
  the utmost that has yet been given to the memory of this great man, the
  entire story of his life has to be built up from the beginning. Fragments
  of papers, scraps of information, however slight, may therefore be of
  material value. A date or a name may contain an important clue, and will
  be thankfully acknowledged. Of course I do not wish to be referred to
  information contained in well-known collections, such as Thurloe,
  Rushworth, Whitelock, and the Parliamentary Histories, nor to the
  Deptford MSS. in the Tower, the Admiralty papers in the State Paper
  Office, or the Ashmole MSS. at Oxford. I am also acquainted, of course,
  with several papers in the national collection of MSS. at the British
  Museum throwing light on the subject; but while these MSS. remain in
  their present state, it would be very rash in any man to say what is
  <i>not</i> to be found in them. Should any one, in reading for his own
  purposes, stumble on a fact of importance for me in these MSS., I shall
  be grateful for a communication; but my appeal is rather made to the
  possessors of old family papers. There must, I think, be many
  letters&mdash;though he was a brief and abrupt correspondent&mdash;of the
  admiral's still existing in the archives of old Puritan families. These
  are the materials of history of which I am most in need.</p>

  of a baker; and we learn from Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i> that the word
  "simnel" signified a kind of sweet-bread or cake. Now, considering the
  uncertainty and mutability of surnames in former times, I am led to
  suspect that "Simnel" may have been a nickname first applied to his
  father, in allusion to his trade; and I am strengthened in my suspicion
  by not finding any such name as "Simnel" in any index of ancient names.

  <i>sewells</i> (I may be wrong as to the orthography), which are simply
  long lines with feathers attached at intervals, somewhat after the
  fashion of the tails of kites. These "sewells," when stretched at length
  on the ground, the herd of deer will very rarely pass; but on coming up
  will check themselves suddenly when in full career, and wheel about. The
  same contrivance was in use in Virgil's time for the same purpose, under

<h3>JOHN TRADESCANT PROBABLY AN ENGLISHMAN,
AND HIS VOYAGE TO RUSSIA IN 1618.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., pp. 119. 286. 353.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Dr. Rimbault</span> justly observes that "the history
  of the Tradescants is involved in considerable obscurity." He does not,
  however, seem to have been aware that some light has been thrown on that
  of the elder John Tradescant by the researches of Dr. Hamel, in his
  interesting Memoir published in the <i>Transactions of the Imperial
  Academy of St. Petersburg in 1847</i>, with the following
  title:&mdash;"Tradescant der Æltere 1618 in Russland. Der <!-- Page 392
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page392"></a>{392}</span>Handelsverkehr
  zwischen England und Russland in seiner Entstehung," &amp;c.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Dr. Rimbault's</span> note contains a good epitome of
  the most obvious English notices respecting the Tradescants; but while
  correcting the errors of others, he has himself fallen into one important
  mistake, in stating that "Old John Tradescant died in 1652;" for that is
  the date of the death of his grandson, John, who died young. Old John
  died in 1638, leaving a son, also named John, who was born in 1608, and
  died in 1662, having survived his only son ten years; and, having no heir
  to his treasures, he had previously conveyed them, by deed of gift, to
  Elias Ashmole, who seems to have contrived to make himself agreeable to
  him by his pursuits as a virtuoso, and by his alchemical and astrological
  fancies. When Dr. Hamel was in England, I had the pleasure of indicating
  to him the site of "Tradescant's Ark" in South Lambeth. It was situate on
  the east side of the road leading from Vauxhall to Stockwell, nearly
  opposite to what was formerly called Spring Lane. Ashmole built a large
  brick house near that which had been Tradescant's, out of the back of
  part of which he made offices. The front part of it became the habitation
  of the well-known antiquary, Dr. Ducarel. It still remains as two
  dwellings; the one, known as "Turret House," is occupied by John Miles
  Thorn, Esq., and the other, called "Stamford House," is the dwelling of
  J.&nbsp;A. Fulton, Esq.</p>

  <p>In his indefatigable researches to elucidate the early intercourse
  between England and Russia, Dr. Hamel's attention was accidentally called
  to the Tradescants and their Museum; and the following passage in
  Parkinson's <i>Paradisus Terrestris</i>, p. 345. (Art. "Neesewort," then
  called <i>Elleborus albus</i>), led to the discovery of a relation of Old
  John's voyage to Russia:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This (says Parkinson) grows in many places in Germany, and likewise
  in certain places in Russia, in such abundance, that, according to the
  relation of that worthy, curious, and diligent searcher and preserver of
  all nature's rarities and varieties, my very good friend John
  Tradescante, of whom I have many times before spoken, a moderately large
  ship (as he says) might be laden with the roots thereof, which he there
  saw on a certain island."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The same notice, in other words, also occurs in Parkinson's
  <i>Theatrum</i>, p. 218.</p>

  <p>In searching among the MSS. in the Ashmolean Museum, Dr. Hamel bore
  this passage in memory, and one MS., thus described in Mr. Black's
  excellent catalogue, No. 824., xvi., contained confirmatory matter:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead">"A Voiag of Ambassad undertaken by the Right
Honnorabl S<sup>r</sup> Dudlie Diggs, in the year 1618."</p>

  <p>"This curious narrative of the voyage round the North Cape to
  Archangel, begins with a list of the chief persons employed in the
  embassy, and contains observations of the weather, and on the commercial,
  agricultural, and domestic state of Russia at that time. It is written in
  a rude hand, and by a person unskilled in composition. The last half page
  contains some chronological notes and other stuff, perhaps written by the
  same hand."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thus far Mr. Black. The full title of the MS. is,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Viag of Ambassad undertaken by the Right Honnorabl S<sup>r</sup>
  Dudlie Diggs in the year 1618, being atended on withe 6 Gentillmen,
  whiche beare the nam of the king's Gentillmen, whose names be heere
  notted. On M. Nowell, brother to the Lord Nowell, M. Thomas Finche, M.
  Woodward, M. Cooke, M. Fante, and M. Henry Wyeld, withe every on of them
  ther man. Other folloers, on Brigges, Interpreter, M. Jams, an Oxford
  man, his Chaplin, on M. Leake his Secretary, withe 3 Scots; on Captain
  Gilbert and his Son, withe on Car, also M. Mathew De Quester's Son, of
  Filpot Lane, in London, the rest his own retenant, some 13 <i>whearof</i>
  (<i>Note on Jonne an Coplie wustersher men</i>) M. Swanli of Limhouse,
  master of the good Ship called the Dianna of Newcastell, M. Nelson, part
  owner of Newe Castell."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dr. Hamel says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"What the words in Italics may signify is not quite clear, but that
  'on Jonne' must relate to Tradescante himself. Perhaps this passage may
  lead to the discovery that Tradescant did not, as it has been
  conjectured, come from Holland, but that he was a native of
  Worcestershire. The name Tradescant might be an assumed one (it was also
  written <i>Tradeskin</i>, which might be interpreted
  <i>Fellmonger</i>)."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From documents in the archives at Moscow, Dr. Hamel recovered the
  Christian names, and a list of Sir Dudley Digges' attendants in this
  voyage, which corresponds with that in the MS., thus:&mdash;<i>Arthur</i>
  Nowell, <i>Thomas</i> Woodward, <i>Adam</i> Cooke, <i>Joseph</i> Fante,
  <i>Thomas</i> Leake, <i>Richard</i> James, <i>George</i> Brigges,
  <i>Jessy</i> De Quester, <i>Adam</i> Jones, <i>Thomas</i> Wakefield,
  <i>John</i> Adams, <i>Thomas</i> Crisp, <i>Leonard</i> Hugh, and <span
  class="sc">John Coplie</span>. This last must therefore have designated
  <i>John Tradescant</i> himself, who was certainly there.</p>

  <p>Sir Dudley Digges, to whom Tradescant seems to have attached himself
  in order to obtain knowledge of the plants and other natural curiosities
  of Russia, was sent by King James I. to the Czar Michael Fedorowitsch,
  who had in the previous year despatched an embassy to the king,
  principally to negotiate for a loan. This ambassador, Wolünsky, returned
  at the same time, in another vessel accompanying that of Sir Dudley.</p>

  <p>Dr. Hamel in his memoir has given considerable extracts from the MS.
  narrative of the voyage, which show that Tradescant was an accurate
  observer not only of objects connected with his studies of phytology and
  natural history, but of other matters. Parkinson has justly styled him "a
  painful industrious searcher and lover of all natural varieties;" and
  elsewhere says: "My very <!-- Page 393 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page393"></a>{393}</span>good friend, John Tradescantes, has
  wonderfully laboured to obtain all the rarest fruits hee can heare of in
  any place of Christendome, Turky, yea, or the whole world." The passages
  in the journal of his voyage, which prove it to be indubitably his, are
  numerous, but the one which first struck Dr. Hamel was sufficient; for in
  following the narrator on the Dwina, and the islands there, and, among
  others, to Rose Island, he found this note, "Helebros albus, enoug to
  load a ship." There are, however, others confirmatory beyond a doubt.
  Parkinson, in his <i>Paradisus Terrestris</i>, p. 528., has the following
  passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is another (strawberry) very like unto this (the Virginia
  strawberry, which carrieth the greatest leafe of any other except the
  Bohemian), that John Tradescante brought with him from Brussels (l.
  Russia) long ago, and in seven years could never see one berry ripe on
  all sides, but still the better part rotten, although it would flower
  abundantly every yeare, and beare very large leaves."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Tradescant mentions that he also saw strawberries to be sold in
  Russia, but could never get of the plants, though he saw the berries
  three times at Sir D. Digges's table; but as they were in nothing
  differing from ours, but only less, he did not much seek after them. It
  is most probable that he brought seed, as he did of another berry, of
  which he sent part, he tells us, to his correspondent Vespasian Robin at
  Paris.</p>

  <p>Of a man to whom the merit is due of having founded the earliest
  Museum of Natural History and Rarities of Art in England, and who
  possessed one of the first, and at the same the best, Botanic Garden,
  every little particular must be interesting, and it would be pleasing to
  find that he was an Englishman, and not a foreigner. The only ground for
  the latter supposition is, I believe, the assertion of Anthony à Wood,
  that he was a Fleming or a Dutchman. The name Tradescant is, however,
  neither Flemish nor Dutch, and seems to me much more like an assumed
  English pseudonyme. That he was neither a Dutchman nor a Fleming will, I
  think, be obvious from the following passage in the narration of his
  travels:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Also, I haue been tould that theare growethe in the land bothe
  tulipes and narsisus. By a Brabander I was tould it, thoug by his name I
  should rather think him a Holander. His name is Jonson, and hathe a house
  at Archangell. He may be eyther, for he [is] always dr&#x16B;ke once in a
  day."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now, had Tradescant himself been a Fleming or a Dutchman, he would at
  least have been able to speak decisively on this occasion; to say nothing
  of the vice of intemperance which he attributes to the natives of those
  countries. Again, it is quite clear that this journal of travels was
  written by Tradescant; yet that name does not appear either in the MS. or
  in the Russian archives: but we have <i>John Coplie</i> in both, with the
  indication in the MS. that he was <i>a Worcestershire man</i>. Let us
  therefore, on these grounds, place him in the list of English worthies to
  whom we owe a debt of gratitude. But supposing <i>Tradescant</i> to have
  been his real name, it is quite evident that he travelled under the name
  of <i>John Coplie</i>; and it is perhaps vain to speculate upon the
  reasons for the assumption of a pseudonyme either way.</p>

  <p>Dr. Richard James, who accompanied Sir Dudley Digges as chaplain,
  appears, from Turner's account of his MSS., which are deposited in the
  Bodleian, to have left behind him a MS. account of his travels in Russia,
  in five sheets; but his MS. seems to have been lost or mislaid in that
  vast emporium, or we might have some confirmation from it respecting
  Tradescant.</p>

  <p>South Lambeth was in former times one of the most agreeable and
  salubrious spots in the vicinity of London, and at the time when
  Tradescant first planted his garden he must have had another worthy and
  distinguished man for a neighbour, Sir Noel Caron, who was resident
  ambassador here from the States of Holland for twenty-eight years. His
  estate contained 122 acres; he was a benefactor to the poor of his
  vicinity by charitable actions, some of which remain as permanent
  monuments of his benevolence, in the shape of almshouses, situate in the
  Wandsworth Road. The site of Caron House is now possessed by Henry
  Beaufoy, Esq., who has worthily emulated the deeds of his predecessor by
  acts of munificent benevolence, which must be fraught with incalculable
  good for ages yet to come. Mr. Beaufoy has, among his literary treasures,
  a very interesting collection of letters in MS., written in French, by
  Sir Noel Caron to Constantine Huyghens, I think, which contain many
  curious illustrations of the events of that period.</p>

  <p>Let us hope that time may bring to light further and more complete
  materials for the biography of these Lambethan worthies, who have
  deserved to live in our memories as benefactors to mankind.</p>

<h3>THE FAMILY OF THE TRADESCANTS.</h3>

  <p>In Chambers's <i>Edinburgh Journal</i>, No. 359., New Series, may be
  found an account of this family, written by myself; I hope to be excused
  when I say that it is the most accurate hitherto published. It gave me
  great pleasure to find that so distinguished an antiquary as <span
  class="sc">Dr. Rimbault</span> mainly corroborates the article alluded
  to; but I regret that I feel bound to notice a serious error into which
  that gentleman has fallen. <span class="sc">Dr. R.</span> states that
  "Old John Tradescant died in the year 1652;" and in another place he
  states that&mdash; <!-- Page 394 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page394"></a>{394}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was not the <i>youngest</i> John Tradescant that died in 1652, but
  the <i>oldest</i>, the <i>grandfather</i>, the first of that name that
  settled in England."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The conflicting accounts and confusion in the history of the
  Tradescants, have no doubt arisen from the three, "grandsire, father, and
  son," having been all named John; consequently, for the sake of
  perspicuity, I shall adopt the plan of our worthy editor, and designate
  the Tradescant who first settled in England, No. 1.; his son, who
  published the <i>Musæum Tradescantianum</i>, No. 2.; and the son of the
  latter, who "died in his spring," No. 3. Now, to prove that it was the
  youngest of the Tradescants, No. 3., who died in 1652, we have only to
  refer to the preface of the <i>Musæum Tradescantianum</i>, which was
  published in 1656. There we find that Tradescant No. 2. says
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"About three years agoe (by the perswasion of some friends) I was
  resolved to take a catalogue of those rarities and curiosities, which my
  father had sedulously collected, and myself with continued diligence have
  augmented and hitherto preserved together."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He then proceeds to account for the delay in the publication of the
  work in these words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Presently thereupon my <i>onely son</i> died, one of my friends fell
  sick," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again, in Ashmole's <i>Diary</i> we find the following entry:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Sept.</i> 11th, 1652. Young John Tredescant died."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And, further on, Ashmole states that</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He was buried by his grandfather, in Lambeth Churchyard."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The word <i>by</i>, in the quotation, meaning, <i>by the side of</i>,
  <i>close by</i> his grandfather. The burial register of Lambeth parish
  gives the date of the interment, Sept. 16, 1652. Ashmole's <i>Diary</i>,
  as quoted by <span class="sc">Dr. Rimbault</span>, and the burial
  register also, give the date of the death of Tradescant No. 2., who
  survived his son ten years: the family then became extinct.</p>

  <p>Ashmole, who became acquainted with the Tradescants in 1650, never
  mentions the grandfather (No. 1.), nor is his name to be found in the
  burial registry; and consequently the date of his death, as far as I have
  read, has always been set down as uncertain. There are other parish
  records, however, than burial registers; and I was well repaid for my
  search by finding, in the Churchwardens' Accounts of St. Mary's, Lambeth,
  the following entries:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1634. June 1. Received for burial of Jane, wife of John Tradeskin,
  12<i>s.</i>"</p>

  <p>"1637-8. Item. John Tradeskin; ye gret bell and black cloth,
  5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This last entry, in all probability, marks the date of the death of
  the first Tradescant. Assuming that it does, and as the engraving by
  Hollar represents him as far advanced in years, his age did not exclude
  him from having been in the service of Queen Elizabeth, so much so as it
  would if he had died in 1652. I read the line on the
  tombstone,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Both gardeners to the Rose and Lily Queen"&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>as signifying that one of the Tradescants had been gardener to
  Elizabeth, the Rose Queen, and the other to Henrietta, the Lily Queen.
  However, as that is little more than a matter of opinion, not of
  historical fact, it need not be further alluded to at present.</p>

  <p>I am happy to say, that I have every reason to believe that I am on
  the trace of new, curious, and indisputably authentic information
  respecting the Tradescants. If successful, and if the editor will spare
  me a corner, I shall be proud to communicate it to the readers of "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>."</p>

  <p>Tradescant's house, and the house adjoining, where Ashmole lived,
  previous to his taking possession of Tradescant's house, after Mrs.
  Tradescant's death (see Ashmole's <i>Diary</i>), are still standing,
  though they have undergone many alterations. Even there, the name of
  Tradescant seems forgotten: the venerable building is only known by a
  <i>nick-name</i>, derived most probably from its antique chimneys. I had
  many weary pilgrimages before I discovered the identical edifice. I have
  not seen the interior, but am aware that there are some traces of Ashmole
  in the house, but none whatever of Tradescant in either house or garden.
  I had a conversation with the gardener of the gentleman who now occupies
  it: he appeared to have an indistinct idea that an adept in his own
  profession had once lived there, for he observed that, "If old
  What's-his-name were alive now, the potato disease could soon be cured."
  Oh! what we antiquaries meet with! He further gave me to understand that
  "<i>furriners</i> sometimes came there wishing to see the place, but that
  I was the only Englishman, that he recollected, who expressed any
  curiosity about it."</p>

  <p>The <i>restorers</i> of the tomb of the Tradescants merely took away
  the old leger stone, on which were cut the words quoted by A.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;H. (Vol.
  iii., p. 207.), and replaced it by a new stone bearing the lines quoted
  by <span class="sc">Dr. Rimbault</span>, which were not on the original
  stone (see Aubrey's <i>Surrey</i>), and the words&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">"Erected 1662.<br />
Repaired by Subscription, 1773."</p>

  <p>But although the name of the childless, persecuted widow, Hester
  Tradescant, is not now on the tomb which she piously erected to the
  memories of her husband and son; still, on the west end of it, can be
  traced the form of a hydra tearing a human skull&mdash;fit emblem of the
  foul and vulture-like rapacity of Elias Ashmole.</p>

<h3>POPE JOAN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 265.)</p>

  <p>In reply to your correspondent <span class="sc">Nemo's</span> Query,
  whether any such personage as Pope Joan ever held the keys of St. Peter,
  and wore the tiara? and if so, at what period, and for what time, and
  what is known of her personal history? I would remark that the story runs
  thus: that between the pontificates of Leo IV., who died in the year 855,
  and of Benedict III., who died in 858, a female of the name of Joan found
  means to cause herself to be elected Pope, which post she held for a term
  of upwards of two years, under the title of Joannes VII., according to
  Sabellicus, or, according to Platina, of Joannes VIII. She is generally
  said to have been an Englishwoman, the daughter of a priest, who in her
  youth became acquainted with an English monk belonging to the Abbey of
  Fulda, with whom she travelled, habited as a man, to many universities,
  but finally settled at Athens, where she remained until the death of her
  companion, and attained to a great proficiency in the learning common to
  the time. After this she proceeded to Rome, and having by the talent she
  displayed in several disputes obtained the reputation of a learned
  divine, was, on the death of Leo IV., elected to fill the pontifical
  chair. This position she held for upwards of two years, but soon after
  the expiration of that time was delivered of a child (but died during
  parturition), while proceeding in a procession between the Coliseum and
  the Church of St. Clemente.</p>

  <p>The first mention of this story appears to have been made by Marianus
  Scotus, who compiled a chronicle at Mayence, about two hundred years
  after the event is said to have occurred, viz. about 1083. He was
  followed by Sigebert de Gemblours, who wrote about 1112; and also by
  Martino di Cistello, or Polonus, who wrote about 1277; since when the
  story has been repeated by numberless authors, all of whom have, more or
  less, made some absurd additions.</p>

  <p>After the satisfactory proofs of the fictitious character of the
  story, which have been produced by the most eminent writers, both
  Catholic and Protestant, it may appear a work of supererogation to add
  anything on the point; yet it may perhaps be permitted to observe, that
  in the most ancient and esteemed manuscripts of the works of the authors
  above quoted, no mention whatever is made of the Papissa Giovanna, and
  its introduction must therefore have been the work of some later
  copyist.</p>

  <p>The contemporary writers, moreover, some of whom were ocular witnesses
  of the elections both of Leo IV. and Benedict III., make no mention
  whatever of the circumstance; and it is well known that at Athens, where
  she is stated to have studied, no such school as the one alluded to
  existed in the ninth century.</p>

  <p>The fact will not, I think, be denied that it was the practice of the
  chroniclers of the early ages to note down the greater portion of what
  they heard, without examining critically as to the credibility of the
  report; and the mention of a fact once made, was amply sufficient for all
  succeeding authors to copy the statement, and make such additions thereto
  as best suited their respective fancies, without making any examination
  as to the truth or probability of the original statement. And this
  appears to have been the case with the point in question: Marianus Scotus
  first stated, or rather some later copyist stated for him, the fact of a
  female Pope; and subsequent writers added, at a later period, the
  additional facts which now render the tale so evidently an invention.</p>

  <p><i>Pope Joan</i> (Vol. iii., p. 265.).&mdash;You have referred to Sir
  Thomas Browne, and might have added the opinion of his able editor
  (<i>Works</i>, iii. 360.), who says, "Her very existence itself seems now
  to be universally rejected by the best authorities as a fabrication from
  beginning to end." On the other hand, old Coryat, in his <i>Crudities</i>
  (vol. ii. p. 443.), has the boldness to speak with "certainty of her
  birth at a particular place,&mdash;viz. at Mentz." Mosheim tells us (vol.
  ii. p. 300.) that during the five centuries succeeding 855, "the event
  was generally believed." He quotes some distinguished names, as well
  among those who maintained the truth of the story as amongst those who
  rejected it as a fable. Bayle may be included amongst the latter, who, in
  the third volume of his Dictionary (Article <span
  class="sc">Papesse</span>), has gone deeply into the question. Mosheim
  himself seems to leave it where Sir Roger de Coverley would have
  done,&mdash;"much may be said on both sides."</p>

  <p><i>Robert Burton, his Birth-place</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 106.

  give conclusive testimony respecting the birth-place of
  Burton:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Barlaam and Josaphat</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 135. 278.).&mdash;I do not
  know of any English translation of this work. If any Middle Age version
  exists, it should be published immediately. A new and excellent
  <i>German</i> one (by Felix Liebrecht, Münster, 1847) has lately
  appeared, written, however, for Romish purposes, as much as from
  admiration of the work itself. It would be well if some member of our own
  pure branch of the Church Catholic would turn his attention to this noble
  work, and give us a faithful but fresh and easy translation, with a
  literary introduction descriptive of all the known versions, &amp;c.; and
  a chapter on the meaning and limits of the asceticism preached in the
  original. In this case, and if published <i>cheap</i>, as it ought to be,
  it would be a golden present for our youth, and would soon become once
  more a <i>folk-book</i>. The beautiful free <i>Old Norwegian</i> version
  (written by King Hákon Sverresson, about <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  1200) mentioned in my last has now been published in Christiania, edited
  by the well-known scholars R. Keyser and C.&nbsp;R. Unger, and illustrated by
  an introduction, notes, glossary, fac-simile, &amp;c. (<i>Barlaams ok
  Josaphats Saga.</i> 8vo. Christiania, 1851.) The editors re-adopt the
  formerly received opinion, that the Greek original (now printed in
  Boissonade's <i>Anecdota Græca</i>, vol. iv.) is not older than the
  eighth century, and was composed by Johannes Damascenus. But this must be
  decided by future criticism.</p>

  <p><i>Witte van Haemstede</i> (Vol. iii., p. 209).&mdash;It may be of use
  to the editors of the "<span class="sc">Navorscher</span>" to know that
  <i>Adrianus Hamstedius</i> became pastor of the Dutch church in Austin
  Friars, London, in the year 1559. He succeeded Walterus Delaenus, and
  resigned his office, one year after his appointment, in favour of Petrus
  Delaenus, probably a son of the before-named Walterus.</p>

  <p>I cannot answer the question as to whether there still exist any
  descendants of <i>Witte van Haemstede</i>; but as late as 1740,
  <i>Hendrik van Haemstede</i> was appointed pastor to the Dutch
  congregation in London. He held the office until the year 1751, when
  Henricus Putman succeeded him.</p>

  <p><i>Fest Sittings</i> (Vol. iii., p. 328.).&mdash;<i>Festing</i> is, I

  was a person who stood as a surety or pledge for another. "Festing-penny"
  was the money given as an earnest or token to servants when hired.</p>

  <p>In the word <i>sittings</i> there <i>might</i> be some reference to
  the <i>statute-sessions</i>, which were courts or tribunals designed for
  the settlement of disputes between masters and servants.</p>

  <p>"<i>Après moi le Déluge</i>" (Vol. iii, p. 299.).&mdash;This sentiment

  that the conflagration of the world should occur after his death; he
  wished that it should take place during his lifetime.</p>

  <p>Dio Cassius (lviii. 23.) attributes this verse, not to Nero, but to
  Tiberius, who, he says, used frequently to repeat it. See Prov. (app. ii.

  <p>the use of which has been imputed to the emperor Nero. The spirit of
  Madame de Pompadour's saying breathes the same selfish levity; and it
  amounts to the same thing. But it merits remark that the words of
  Metternich were of an entirely distinct signification. They did not imply
  that he <i>cared</i> only for himself and the affairs of his own life;
  but that he anticipated the inability of future ministers to avert
  revolution, and <i>foreboded</i> the worst. Two persons may use the same
  words, and yet their sayings be as different as the first line of Homer
  from the first of Virgil. The omission of the French verb disguises the

  <p>"And while they were at a loss what to do, a certain Rhodian came up

  here many sheep, and goats, and oxen, and asses; which, being flayed, and
  (their skins) inflated, would readily furnish a means of transport. And I
  shall require also the girths, which you use for the beasts of burden.
  And on these,' said he, 'having bound the leathern bags, and fastened
  them one to another, and affixing stones, and letting them down like
  anchors, and binding them on either side, I will lay on wood, and put
  earth over them. And that you will not then sink, you shall presently
  very clearly perceive; for each leathern bag will support two men from
  sinking, and the wood and earth will keep them from slipping."</p>

  <p><i>Curious Facts in Natural History</i> (Vol. iii., p.
  166.).&mdash;There is a parallel to the curious fact contributed by your
  Brazilian correspondent in the "vegetable caterpillar" of New Zealand.
  This natural rarity is described in Angas's <i>Savage Life and Scenes in
  Australia and New Zealand</i>, vol. i. p. 291.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Amongst the damp moss at the root of the <i>rata</i> trees, in the
  shady forests not far from Auckland, and also in various parts of the
  northern island, are found those extraordinary productions called
  vegetable caterpillars, the <i>hotete</i> of the natives. In appearance,
  the caterpillar differs but little from that of the common privet
  sphinx-moth, after it has descended to the ground, previously to its
  undergoing the change into the chrysalis state. But the most remarkable
  characteristic of the vegetable caterpillar is, that every one has a very
  curious plant, belonging to the fungi tribe, growing from the
  <i>anus</i>; this fungus varies from three to six inches in length, and
  bears at its extremity a blossom-like appendage, somewhat resembling a
  miniature bulrush, and evidently derives its nourishment from the body of
  the insect. This caterpillar when recently found, is of the substance of
  cork; and it is discovered by the natives seeing the tips of the fungi,
  which grow upwards. They account for this phenomenon, by asserting that
  the caterpillar, when feeding upon the <i>rata</i> tree overhead,
  swallows the seeds of the fungus, which take root in the body of the
  insect, and germinate as soon as it retreats to the damp mould beneath,
  to undergo its transformation into the pupa state. Specimens of these
  vegetable caterpillars have been transmitted to naturalists in England,
  by whom they have been named <i>Sphæria Robertii</i>."&mdash;<i>Savage
  Life and Scenes in Australia and New Zealand</i>, by G.&nbsp;F. Angas: London,
  1847, vol. i. p. 291.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I recently had several specimens of the insect, with its remarkable
  appendage, which had been brought from the colony by a relative.</p>

  <p><i>Prideaux</i> (Vol. iii., p. 268.).&mdash;The Prideaux, who took
  part in the Monmouth rebellion, was a son of Sir Edmund Prideaux, the
  purchaser of Ford Abbey. (See Birch's <i>Life of Tillotson</i>.)
  Tillotson appears to have been a chaplain to Sir E. Prideaux at Ford
  Abbey, and a tutor to the young Prideaux.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Our readers will probably remember that the result of several
  communications which appeared in our columns on the subject of the
  celebrated <i>Treatise of Equivocation</i>, found in the chambers of
  Tresham, and produced at the trial of the persons engaged in the
  Gunpowder Plot, was a letter from a correspondent (J.&nbsp;B., Vol. ii., p.
  168.) announcing that the identical MS. copy of the work referred to by
  Sir Edward Coke on the occasion in question, was safely preserved in the
  Bodleian Library. It was not to be supposed that a document of such great
  historical interest, which had been long sought after, should, when
  discovered, be suffered to remain unprinted; and Mr. Jardine, the
  accomplished editor of the <i>Criminal Trials</i> (the second volume of
  which, it will be remembered, is entirely devoted to a very masterly
  narrative of the Gunpowder Plot), has accordingly produced a very
  carefully prepared edition of the Tract in question; introduced by a
  preface, in which its historical importance is alone discussed, the
  object of the publication being not controversial but historical. "To
  obviate," says Mr. Jardine, "any misapprehension of the design in
  publishing it at a time when events of a peculiar character have drawn
  much animadversion upon the principles of the Roman Catholics, it should
  be stated that the <i>Treatise</i> would have been published ten years
  ago, had the inquiries then made led to its discovery; and that it is now
  published within a few weeks after the manuscript has been brought to
  light in the Bodleian Library." The work is one of the most important
  contributions to English history which has recently been put forth, and
  Mr. Jardine deserves the highest credit for the manner in which he was
  discharged his editorial duties.</p>

  <p><i>Horæ Egyptiacæ, or the Chronology of Ancient Egypt discovered from
  Astronomical and Hieroglyphical Records, including many dates found in
  coeval inscriptions from the period of the building of the great Pyramid
  to the times of the Persians, and illustrative of the History of the
  first Nineteen Dynasties, &amp;c.</i>, by Reginald Stuart Poole, is the
  ample title of a work dedicated to the Duke of Northumberland, under
  whose auspices it has been produced. The work, which is intended to
  explain the Chronology and History of Ancient Egypt from its monuments,
  originally appeared in a series of <!-- Page 399 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page399"></a>{399}</span>papers in the
  <i>Literary Gazette</i>. These have been improved, the calculations
  contained in them subjected to the most rigid scrutiny; and when we say
  that in the preparation of this volume Mr. Poole has had assistance from
  Mr. Lane, Mr. and Mrs. Lieber of Cairo, Dr. Abbot of Cairo, Mr. Birch of
  the British Museum, Professor Airy, and, lastly, of Sir Gardener
  Wilkinson, who, in his <i>Architecture of Ancient Egypt</i>, avows that
  "he fully agrees with Mr. Poole in the contemporaneousness of certain
  kings, and in the order of succession he gives to the early Pharaohs," we
  do quite enough to recommend it to the attention of all students of the
  History and Monuments of Ancient Egypt.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>Plato Translated by

  the fourth volume of the Translation of Plato, which, strange as it may
  sound to those of our readers who know anything of what is essential to a
  popular book in these days, has, we believe, been one of the most popular
  of the many cheap books issued by Mr. Bohn. How much the impression made
  on the public mind by the well-worn quotation, "Plato, thou reasonest
  well," may have contributed to this result, we leave others to
  decide.&mdash;<i>What is the working of the Church of Spain? What is
